# BFSUsingNWC
1) I have used jupyter notebook for this project and the file is in .ipynb formatÂ .I have used numpy library
2) This code helps you find a basic feasible solution and cost associated with the solution using north west corner method for transportation problems.
3) Give any dimension of supply and demand values in second kernel this method will give the Basic feasible solution and the cost associated with it :)
